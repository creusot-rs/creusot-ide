A VS Code extension providing support for [Creusot](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot), a deductive verifier for Rust code.

This project is work in progress. An official release is upcoming.

## Install Creusot IDE

[Creusot](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot) itself should be installed separately.

Creusot IDE consists of two parts:

1. The **Creusot IDE extension**, installed via VS Code: open VS Code > Extensions > Search "Creusot IDE".

2. The **Creusot LSP language server**, which must currently be installed separately:

        # First, install Creusot, Why3, and Why3find; see https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot for instructions

        git clone https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot-ide
        opam pin creusot-lsp creusot-ide/ -y

## Features

Creusot IDE helps you nagivate between your Rust sources and the verification artifacts generated by Creusot and Why3find.

- Run and inspect proofs from within the editor.
    - Functions with proof obligations will have a button in the gutter to their left.
      Click to run the prover (`why3find prove`).
      Alt+click to start Why3 IDE (only if the prover fails).
- Diagnostics underline locations with failed proofs
- Syntax highlighting:
    - `.rs` files: Creusot-specific attributes and Pearlite expressions,
    - `.coma` files.

## Commands

Available in the command palette (`Ctrl+P`):

- Restart language server
- Stop language server

## Settings

- `creusot.lspPath`: Path to the `creusot-lsp` executable. Default: `""`, to find the executable in `PATH`.

## Known issues

### Compatibility with standard Rust tools (Rust analyzer, etc.)

- Rust analyzer doesn't know how to parse Creusot specifications (attributes such as `ensures`, etc.),
    so they are underlined in red.

    Add this option in `settings.json`:

    ```
    "rust-analyzer.check.overrideCommand": [
            "cargo",
            "creusot",
            "--",
            "--message-format=json"
        ]
    ```

## Developers' corner

To build and install the VS Code extension from source:

```
npx vsce package
```

Then, in VS Code: Command Palette > Install from VSIX. Select the `creusot-ide-X.Y.Z.vsix` file created by the previous command.
