A VS Code extension providing support for [Creusot](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot), a deductive verifier for Rust code.

This project is work in progress. An official release is upcoming.

## Install Creusot IDE

[Creusot](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot) itself should be installed separately.

Creusot IDE consists of two parts:

1. The **Creusot IDE extension**, installed via VS Code: open VS Code > Extensions > Search "Creusot IDE".

2. The **Creusot LSP language server**, which must currently be installed separately:

        git clone https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot-ide
        opam pin creusot-lsp creusot-ide/
        # Say yes to install creusot-lsp

    Creusot LSP currently depends on development versions of Why3 and Why3find.
    (Tested with Why3 commit `9c0548a62` and Why3find commit `7f728e9` + temporary [local patch](./why3find.patch))

        git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/why3/why3
        opam pin why3 why3#9c0548a62

        git clone https://git.frama-c.com/pub/why3find
        cd why3find
        git checkout 7f728e9
        git apply ../creusot-ide/why3find.patch
        git commit -am "patch"
        opam pin why3find .
        cd ..

## Features

Creusot IDE helps you nagivate between your Rust sources and the verification artifacts generated by Creusot and Why3find.

- Run and inspect proofs from within the editor.
    - Functions with proof obligations will have a button in the gutter to their left.
      Click to run the prover (`why3find prove`).
      Alt+click to start Why3 IDE (only if the prover fails).
- Links in your editor between fragments of Rust code and their counterparts in the generated Coma and proof files.
- Display hypotheses and goal at various point of the proof.
- Syntax highlighting:
    - `.rs` files: Creusot-specific attributes and Pearlite expressions,
    - `.coma` files.

## Settings

- `creusot.lspPath`: Path to the `creusot-lsp` executable. Default: `""`, to find the executable in `PATH`.

## Known issues

### Compatibility with standard Rust tools (Rust analyzer, etc.)

- How to build projects verified by Creusot.

    Creusot implicitly enables some unstable features to verify programs.
    When building programs with `cargo build`, they must be enabled explicitly with the following
    attribute in the root `lib.rs`:

    ```rust
    #![cfg_attr(not(creusot),feature(stmt_expr_attributes,proc_macro_hygiene))]
    ```

    Linters will then warn that `creusot` is an unknown parameter. To silence the warning,
    add this option to `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    [lints.rust]
    unexpected_cfgs = { level = "warn", check-cfg = ['cfg(creusot)'] }
    ```

    This issue is being tracked at https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot/issues/1000

- Rust analyzer doesn't know how to parse Creusot specifications (attributes such as `ensures`, etc.),
    so they are underlined in red.

    Add this option in `settings.json`:

    ```
    "rust-analyzer.check.overrideCommand": [
            "cargo",
            "creusot",
            "--",
            "--message-format=json"
        ]
    ```
